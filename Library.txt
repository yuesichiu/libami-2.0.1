Lib AMI Overview
----------------
  Lib AMI is an abstration library for the purposes of making communications between an
an application and the Asterisk PBX server's manager interface easier.
  All of AMI is heavily dependant on one specific structure: ast_packet. ast_packet is
defined in core.h. Documentation on core.h and it's functions is in core.h.

  The manager interface, which is part of the Asterisk PBX, communicates over sockes
in a specific format. The use of this library requires at least a rudimentary
understanding of the manager interface, it's function and format.

The Library
-----------
  The AMI library is divided into six files:

  ami.h:     A wrapper header which includes the other five files. Use this if you plan to use
             most of the functionality of the library.

  core.h:    This file provides the core functionality of the library, including the structure
             used in all of the communication to and from Asterisk, as well as network
             and utility functions.

  admin.h:   Functions used by administrators of the phone server are defined here, including
             functionality for managing Asterisk's internal database and managing queues and
             agents.

  channel.h: Functions for managing channels are defined in this file.
  
  info.h:    Functions for gathering information about different aspects of Asterisk,
             including sip peers, agents, mailboxes, parked calls, channels, and queues are
             defined in this file.

  manager.h: Functions for basic manager activities are defined in this file, including 
             logging in and out of the Asterisk server, pinging the server, and setting
             which events should be received (if any) for a connection.

  Each header file of the library is documented.
